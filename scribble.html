            got baited by my fake back button! Things aren't as simple as that in this maze my friend, there
            is no going back - only forward. Well, unless you've reached the end I guess, but that's besides the point... Anyways, I am
            here to congratulate you on making it to ending 1 out of ... well that is a secret (not that I donâ€™t know
            how many endings there are). I call this ending the Scribble Ending, congratulations!</span>
