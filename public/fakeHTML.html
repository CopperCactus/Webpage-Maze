    <p>Agh, darn it! The HTML page isn't rendering properly! Aww man, this was supposed to be the coolest ending... it was going to be
        the TicTacToe win ending... sure, I know this doesn't look like a super complex webpage, but I'm telling you that CSS document practically contained the 
        secrets of the universe, it was that good... it would render this webpage in such a way that it would've blown your tiny human mind
        because of how good of a webpage it would become. Ah well. Look, help me out here. Can you, like, click around until something happens? Surely it will work... 
        there's probably a way to continue somewhere... I wish you could've seen that CSS...
