  <h1>Scribble</h1>
  <p>Oh. Hi. I didn't expect this to happen. Well, here goes nothing. I didn't expect us to meet face to face.
    I've been the narrator to your journey. I may have even been introduced to you before, but my
    memory is bad, so just in case, my name is Scribble. Apparently, that broken Tic Tac Toe code led you to me,
    and... well... here we are. Oh well. Let's call this "The Meeting Ending"! If you want to keep playing
    my maze, you can click the back button in the bottom left! I've been leaving those around for you. I warn you
    though, I have no object permanence and serious memory problems, so if you click it, it'll be like we never met...</p>
  <a href="main.html"><button class="back-button">Back</button></a>
